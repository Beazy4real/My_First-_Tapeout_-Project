[Tiny Tapeout Puzzles](https://tinytapeout.com/digital_design/holidays/)

In this puzzle you have to work out how to set the switches to get the last led to light up.

Your friend has been working hard to plan a vacation. (Un)fortunately, they love digital logic, so rather than print you an itinerary, they drew you the following digital circuit.
  
Two vacations are possible: can you use the switches to figure out where you'll go, what you'll eat, and what souvenir you'll return with?


| Switch # |           |
|----------|-----------|
| 1        | Beach     |
| 2        | Mountains |
| 3        | Ski       |
| 4        | Swim      |
| 5        | Ice Cream |
| 6        | Fondue    |
| 7        | Tacos     |
| 8        | Sun Burn  |
